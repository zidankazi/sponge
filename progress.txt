## Sponge — Ralph Loop Progress Log
Append-only. Each entry: [story-id] what was done, what was learned, any gotchas.

## Initial State (before loop)
The core product is already fully built and styled. FileTree, CodeEditor (Monaco), ChatTerminal,
Header, LandingScreen, ResultsScreen, Layout — all implemented with full CSS.

Key architecture facts (read before implementing):
- All session state in frontend/src/hooks/useSession.jsx via React Context
- State: sessionId, view, timeLeft, activeFile, openFiles, fileBuffers, chatHistory, isAiLoading, results, isSubmitting, username (to be added in S-02)
- Timer: useEffect on view === 'session', setInterval decrementing timeLeft
- timerRef = useRef(null) — holds the interval ID, used to clearInterval on submit
- submitSession signature: { session_id, final_code } — needs username added in S-02
- api/client.js has USE_MOCK = true — all API calls return mocked data, no backend needed
- vite build (not npm run dev) is the correct validation command for the loop — it catches all import/type errors
- useSession.jsx contains JSX so it must use .jsx extension (learned during setup)
- No router installed — App.jsx uses view state ('idle' | 'session' | 'results') to switch screens
- fileContents.js is large (~3300 lines) — don't read it in full unless necessary
