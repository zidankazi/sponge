## Sponge — Ralph Loop Progress Log (josh/game branch)
Append-only. Each entry: [story-id] what was done, what was learned, any gotchas.

## Context (read before starting)

Branch: josh/game. This branch builds the game layer on top of Zidan's core product.

Key facts:
- All session state lives in hooks/useSession.jsx — import useSession() to get username, results, resetSession
- results shape from submit: { total_score, breakdown, headline_metrics, interpretation, badge }
- badge is one of: "AI Collaborator", "On Your Way", "Needs Work", "Just Vibing"
- leaderboard entries shape: [{ username, score, time_completed, badge }]
- fetchLeaderboard() is in api/client.js — already imported in LeaderboardPage.jsx
- ResultsScreen already works fully (score circle, breakdown bars, metrics). Stories here ADD to it, not replace it.
- DO NOT touch: App.jsx, hooks/useSession.jsx, api/client.js, components/editor/*, components/chat/*
- index.css append-only — add new rules at the very end only
- Validation: cd frontend && npm run build (0 errors required before committing)
- useSession.jsx contains JSX so it uses .jsx extension — don't rename it
- The design system uses CSS custom properties: --green-light (#52b788), --blue (#5588cc), --yellow (#e0b555), --red (#e05555), --bg-surface, --bg-surface-2, --border, --text, --text-secondary, --cream

[G-01] Badge component — pill/chip with tier colors (green/blue/yellow/red) and ◆ dot prefix. Unknown badges render with default styling. CSS appended to index.css.
[G-02] Wired Badge into ResultsScreen below score circle. Destructured `badge` from results. Added .results-badge CSS for centering.
[G-03] Leaderboard component — flexbox table with rank/name/score/badge/time columns. Uses Badge component. currentUser prop highlights matching row. Empty-state message when no entries. Time formatted with toLocaleTimeString.
[G-04] LeaderboardPage — added loading spinner state, Sponge branding header, back button via onBack prop, passes username from useSession as currentUser. Initializes entries as null (not []) so loading state shows.
[G-05] ScoreReveal skeleton — fullscreen centered layout, large score number, Badge, first-sentence interpretation summary, "See Full Breakdown" button calling onComplete. No animation yet.
[G-06] Wired ScoreReveal + LeaderboardPage into ResultsScreen. Three phases via local useState: (1) ScoreReveal, (2) full breakdown with "View Leaderboard" button, (3) LeaderboardPage inline with back button. Added useState import. Gotcha: LeaderboardPage import path is ../../pages/ not ../pages/.
