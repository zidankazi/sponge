# Ralph Progress Log — Sponge Scoring Engine v2
Started: 2026-02-28
---

## Codebase Patterns
- Python venv at backend/venv/ — use `./venv/bin/python` for imports
- All backend imports are flat: `from scoring.vocabulary import ...` (no `backend.` prefix)
- Run quality checks from `backend/` working directory
- engine.py uses `_` prefix for private functions, public entry is `compute_score`

## Iteration 1 — SE-001/002/003: Extract vocabulary, metrics, interpretation modules
### What was implemented
- Extracted RQ_TERMS, TRADEOFF_TERMS, EDGE_CASE_TERMS + 4 helpers to scoring/vocabulary.py
- Extracted compute_headline_metrics + 4 session helpers to scoring/metrics.py (renamed from _compute_headline_metrics to public)
- Extracted _build_interpretation + _has_any_tests_signal to scoring/interpretation.py
- Updated engine.py imports to use new modules

### Files changed
- backend/scoring/vocabulary.py (created)
- backend/scoring/metrics.py (created)
- backend/scoring/interpretation.py (created)
- backend/scoring/engine.py (modified — removed inline definitions, added imports)

### Learnings for future iterations
- _word_overlap is in vocabulary.py (used by both metrics.py and engine.py)
- metrics.py imports from vocabulary.py (_is_grounded, _word_overlap)
- engine.py still imports vocabulary helpers directly for scorer functions
- compute_headline_metrics is the public name (no underscore prefix)
